# DFBedrockResources
Simple resource pack to support the textures used in DFSmpPlugin.  
Bedrock Edition (Tested on 1.21.50+)

Requires GeyserMC Bindings to work (see dfsmpitems.json)

## omitted content
- ./sounds/music/game/records/
  - this folder contains songs of which some are copywrited.
  - to stay safe, i'm ommitting the entire folder.
  - it's not required for the resource pack to work, anyway.
